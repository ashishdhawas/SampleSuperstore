Exploratory Data Analysis is a technique used to understand the different aspects of a dataset. Its main objective is to give a through understand of the data. It is used to summarize the main characteristics of a dataset, to examine data before building model, find patterns, relations and anomalies in data using statistical graphs and other visualization, identify faulty points in data, understand relationship between variables while it's goal is to help businesses understand their customer behaviour/characteristics, business growth, and help make better decisions. Exploratory Data Analysis process is not usually a formal or linear process with a set of rules. There is no common method to perfom EDA.

**To perform EDA on a dataset, you have to; **

Understand the variables in the dataset
Clean the data from redundancies
Analyze relationship between variables
Explore and visualize relationships
Charts and plots such as Histograms, Scatterplots, PMFs and CMFs (to visualize distributions), Boxplots, Line graphs are used for plotting in EDA.

Here's an Exploratory data analysis process on the superstore dataset. The following code is written in Python and mainly uses Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib and Seaborn libraries.
